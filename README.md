# GirlDayEsploraDemoCode
Esplora (obsolete) demo code used by EWB Austin chapter to demo to girls on Girl Day.

## Purpose

This program runs on an Arduion Esplora. It has been used for 10 years now at "International Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day", 
now shortened to "Girl Day".

The Austin Engineers Without Border Chapter has often had a very successful booth a the University of Texas (Austin) Girl Day
celebration. This very simple program is a lot of fun for the young girls; it allows them to make the computer say "Megan is cool!"
or other trivialities, and to change the color of an LED in response to button presses.
